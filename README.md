is a simplified computer model designed by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, as described in their book _The Elements of
Computing Systems_. This architecture is intended to provide a clear and concise understanding of how computers
function, making it an excellent learning tool.

## Features

- Designed to work with assembly code for the HACK computer, as per _The Elements of Computing Systems_ curriculum.
- Easy to use with a simple command-line interface.

## Requirements

- A valid HACK assembly file with an `.asm` extension.

## Installation

You can install `hackasm` by using the python package manager pip.

```shell
